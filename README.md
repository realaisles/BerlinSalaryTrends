### Why an anonymous survey about salaries in Berlin?

Discussing money **is a taboo**. How many times did you tell your colleague about how much you earn? Yes, probably never. We, the employees, have plaftorms like Kununu, Glassdoor, and Levels.fyi that provide salary information, but the data is noisy, inconsistent and inaccurate. 

Employers, on the other hand, often have access to robust benchmarking services that enable them a good visibility into market metrics such as the number of applications per position, expected salary levels, and more. When it comes to salary negotiation this clearly tilts the balance in the favor of employers.

This anonymous survey will not magically level this playing field, but it will provides a platform for an honest sharing of salary information. Hopefully it will help you see how you compare to others and see where you stand. Numbers matter, the higher the number of submissions, the lower the noise.

Let's lower the noise together.

### What is the goal and the benefit?

Our goal is to provide consistent and recurring data collection and analysis.

This will in turn:
- empower YOU to benchmark your salary against others in similar roles or industries, providing a clearer understanding of your market value,
- improve transparency and fairness in performance reviews and interviews,
- identify gaps within industries, roles or demographics,
- serve as a valuable resource for employers to optimize their remuneration practices.

### What is the plan?

Depends of the interest. But if we get to hundreds of entries, the survey will be repeated at least annually. 

### Who can participate?

Anyone working in Berlin. 
This also means employees working remotely for companies in Berlin.


### Where will the results be published?
- Data: the data will be cleaned and then published in .csv on GitHub.
- Analysis: after the data is cleaned, the analysis will also be published at handpickedberlin.com
