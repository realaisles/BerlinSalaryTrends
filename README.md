# Berlin Salary Trends

### Why an anonymous survey about salaries in Berlin?

Salary levels are taboo, because almost nobody publishes their own salary publicly? There is some data available on pages like Kununu, Glassdoor, Levels, but this self-reported data includes a lot of noise. You can also find some data on places like reddit or forums, but again: noise. 

Employers can use benchmarking services and are in clear advantage compared to employees because they also have more visibility in the market with different metrics (eg. number of applications per position, expected salary levels and similar).


### What is the benefit?

The main goal is to help decrease the noise and increase the visibility on the job market for employees on consistent and recurring basis.

Survey will:
- improve your ability to benchmark your own salary to see where you stand,
- promote transparency and fairness,
- highlight the biggest discrepancies and gaps,
- also help companies get improved insights.


### What is the plan?

Depends of the interest. But if we get to hundreds of entries, the survey will be repeated at least annually. 

### Who can participate?

Anyone working in Berlin. 
This also means employees working remotely for companies in Berlin.


### Where will the results be published?
- Data: the data will be cleaned and then published in .csv on GitHub.
- Analysis: after the data is cleaned, the analysis will also be published at handpickedberlin.com
