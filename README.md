## Why an anonymous survey?

Discussing money **is taboo**. How many times did you tell your colleague about how much you earn? Yes, probably never. We, the employees, have platforms like Kununu, Glassdoor, and Levels.fyi that provide salary information, but the data is noisy, inconsistent and inaccurate. 

On the other hand, employers often have access to robust benchmarking services that give them good visibility into market metrics such as the number of applications per position, expected salary levels, and more. Regarding salary negotiation, this clearly tilts the balance **in favour of employers**.

This anonymous survey will not magically level this playing field, but it will provide a platform for the honest sharing of salary information. Hopefully, it will **help you see how you compare to others and see where you stand**. Numbers matter; the higher the number of submissions, the lower the noise.

Let's lower the noise together.

## What are the goal and the benefit?

Our goal is to provide consistent and recurring data collection and analysis.

This will, in turn:
- empower YOU to benchmark your salary against others in similar roles or industries, providing a clearer understanding of your market value,
- improve transparency and fairness in performance reviews and interviews,
- identify gaps within industries, roles or demographics,
- serve as a valuable resource for employers to optimize their remuneration practices.

## What is the plan?

Repeat the survey every six months or at least annually. 
This also depends on the number of responses and the interest generated by the intial "Version June 2023."

## How can you help and get involved?

You can help:
- by participating,
- by spreading the word on social and elsewhere,
- by volunteering to help in other areas.

## Who is "we"? Who is working on this?

The idea originated in the [issue #41 of a hobby newsletter handpicked for Berlin](https://handpickedberlin.substack.com/p/issue41) where a poll _"Would you participate in an anonymous salary survey for Berlin 2023?"_ had a excellent response rate (83% yes with 310 votes). **This is a hobby project without any budget.**

**Current team:**
- Igor, [handpickedberlin.com](https://handpickedberlin.com) (design of June 2023 survey & initial promotion)
- **YOU**, but you have not volunteered yet

**Support is needed in the areas of:**
- data visualisation,
- data analysis (e.g. Jupyter or other methods),
- methodology & questionnaire improvements (if the survey will be recurring),
- promotion (increasing the reach),
- validation of German translation of README
- improve data privacy & confidentiality disclaimer.

Do you have relevant skills? Let me know!

## Where will the results be published?
- Raw data: the data will be published in a cleaned and uncleaned version in this repo (deadline is mentioned in the survey itself) in accordance to Data privacy and confidentiality disclaimer (aggregated to prevent singling out)
- Analysis: an analysis/report will also be published in a form of an article at handpickedberlin.com

This license allows for the data to be freely used and shared while still providing some level of protection against commercial exploitation. 

If you have any questions about how you can use the data, please refer to the CC BY-NC-SA license or contact the team for more information.

For explicit permission for commercial use (eg. articles with paywalls) please approach the team.

### Usage scenarios

1.  Non-commercial use: A non-profit organization can use the survey results to create a report on industry salaries because they don't intend to make a profit from it.
2.  Commercial use with permission: A consulting firm or an influencer/consultant (LinkedIn & similar) can use the survey results to create a market research report if they obtain permission from the original source of the data.
3.  Use in a newspaper article: A newspaper can use the survey results to support an article on industry salaries if they attribute the data to the original source and the article is not for commercial purposes.
4.  Use behind a paywall: A news website can use the survey results to create a paywalled report on industry salaries if they negotiate a separate license with the original source of the data, which might involve paying a fee or agreeing to other conditions.

## Data Privacy and Confidentiality Disclaimer

**Introduction**

This policy outlines how we collect, store, use, and protect your data during the Berlin Salary Survey.

**GDPR Compliance**

As the private entity administrators of this survey, **we operate under the assumption that we do not process personal data as per the GDPR definition, given the anonymous design of the survey**. We make every effort to avoid any potential singling out of individuals; this includes grouping data points and removing any potentially identifiable information. Only aggregated data sets ensuring k-anonymity (5 or more individuals in a group) will be published, and any data that could lead to identification will be removed from the dataset. All questions have been designed to avoid collecting unnecessary or excessive data to focus on data minimization.

**Anonymous Survey and Your Privacy**

The Berlin Salary Survey is conducted anonymously. We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, email addresses, or IP addresses unless you voluntarily provide such information in free form fields. These free form entries will be removed. Individual responses won't be singled out; the results will be published in aggregate form ensuring that no singling out would be possible. 

**Google Forms and Data Privacy**

We use Google Forms for this survey. While we don't collect identifiable information, Google may technically access this data. If you are logged into a Google account while participating, Google might collect and use your information according to its own privacy policies. Thus, your responses may not be 100% anonymous from Google's perspective.

To limit the potential for Google's data collection when completing this survey, you may consider using your browser's incognito or private browsing mode. This mode prevents your browsing history from being stored and discards cookies after you close the incognito or private browsing window. By doing so, you reduce the chances of Google associating your survey responses with your Google account. However, this does not guarantee complete anonymity from Google's perspective, as they may still collect certain information during your session.

**Your Participation is Voluntary**

Participation in this survey is entirely voluntary. You have the freedom to not answer certain questions or withdraw from the survey at any time. However, please avoid sharing any sensitive information in free fields that you wouldn't want publicly associated with your responses.

**Data Usage**

The data collected will be used to create a public report on salary trends in Berlin. This report will be openly available, supporting transparency in salary discussions. If you consent to participate in this survey, you agree to this use of the data.

**User Access and Correction of Data**

Due to the anonymous nature of the survey, we cannot provide an option for participants to access or correct their data post-submission. This is because we cannot identify your specific responses unless you voluntarily identified yourself in any of the free text fields. Please review your answers carefully before submitting, as we can't facilitate modifications once the data is collected.

**Data Storage and Retention**

All data collected from the survey responses are stored in aggregated form indefinitely on this GitHub repository. This data will be stored securely and will be openly available for everyone to access under the license defined in the 'License & Usage of Survey Data' section. The collected data will be retained for historical reference and to track salary trends over time.

**Consent to Participate**

By proceeding with the survey, you confirm your understanding of these details and voluntarily consent to participate under these conditions.

**Contact**

If you have any concerns or questions regarding this policy, please feel free to contact us.
