## Why an anonymous survey?

Discussing money **is a taboo**. How many times did you tell your colleague about how much you earn? Yes, probably never. We, the employees, have plaftorms like Kununu, Glassdoor, and Levels.fyi that provide salary information, but the data is noisy, inconsistent and inaccurate. 

Employers, on the other hand, often have access to robust benchmarking services that enable them a good visibility into market metrics such as the number of applications per position, expected salary levels, and more. When it comes to salary negotiation this clearly tilts the balance in the favor of employers.

This anonymous survey will not magically level this playing field, but it will provides a platform for an honest sharing of salary information. Hopefully it will help you see how you compare to others and see where you stand. Numbers matter, the higher the number of submissions, the lower the noise.

Let's lower the noise together.

## What is the goal and the benefit?

Our goal is to provide consistent and recurring data collection and analysis.

This will in turn:
- empower YOU to benchmark your salary against others in similar roles or industries, providing a clearer understanding of your market value,
- improve transparency and fairness in performance reviews and interviews,
- identify gaps within industries, roles or demographics,
- serve as a valuable resource for employers to optimize their remuneration practices.

## What is the plan?

Ideally to repeat the survey each six months or at least annualy. 
This also depends on the number of responses and the interest generated by the intial Version June 2023.

## How can you help and get involved?

You can help:
- by participating,
- by spreading the word on social and elsewhere,
- by volunteering to help in other areas (see next chapter).

## Who is "we"? Who is working on this?

The idea originated in the [issue #41 of a hobby newsletter handpicked for Berlin](https://handpickedberlin.substack.com/p/issue41) where a poll _"Would you participate in an anonymous salary survey for Berlin 2023?"_ had a great response rate (83% yes with 310 votes).

**Current team:**
- Igor, [handpickedberlin.com](https://handpickedberlin.com) (design of June 2023 survey & initial promotion)
- **YOU**, but you have not volunteered yet

**Support is needed in the areas of:**
- data visualisation,
- data analysis (eg. Jupyter or other methods),
- methodology & questionnaire improvements (if the survey will be recurring),
- promotion (increasing the reach),
- validation of German translation of README.

Do you have fitting skills? Let me know!

## Where will the results be published?
- Raw data: the data will be published in cleaned and uncleaned version in this repo (deadline is mentioned in the survey itself)
- Analysis: a basic analysis will also be published in a form of an article at handpickedberlin.com
